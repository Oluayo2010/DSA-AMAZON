## 📈 Insights & Recommendations

### 💡 Insight 1: A Few Products Generate Most of the Revenue

Only a handful of products account for the majority of potential revenue. These products have **high ratings** and **lots of customer reviews**.

✅ **Action**: Promote top 10 products more. Use Amazon ads, SEO, and better listings to boost visibility.

---

### 💡 Insight 2: Big Discounts Don't Always Mean Big Sales

Many products offer 50%+ discounts, but they don’t always lead to more visibility or potential revenue.

✅ **Action**: Use high discounts only during events or for inventory clearance. Test smaller discounts (10–30%) on popular products.

---

### 💡 Insight 3: Strong Reviews & Ratings = Higher Revenue

Products rated 3.5 stars or more with many reviews consistently outperform others.

✅ **Action**: Ask satisfied customers to leave reviews. **Highlight** top-rated products on the store homepage.

---

### 💡 Insight 4: Specific Categories Perform Better (Based on Names/Patterns)

Some product types or keywords appear more in top performers (e.g., gadgets, accessories).

✅ **Action**: Focus inventory and marketing on winning categories. Reduce low-performing products.
